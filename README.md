**Task overview:**
Develop a web application that allows users to input and track their daily expenses across various categories. The application should help users manage their finances by categorizing, summarizing, and limiting expenses.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Expense Input:**

   - Users can enter expenses in categories such as Groceries, Transportation, Healthcare, Utility, Charity, and Miscellaneous.
   - For each expense entry, users must specify the purpose of the expense (e.g., "Groceries for the week").
   - The date and time of the expense should be automatically recorded when the expense is added.

2. **Expenses Management:**

   - Expenses are stored in a MongoDB database.
   - Users can input expenses multiple times per day.

3. **Summary Page:**

- The application should display a categorized summary of the userâ€™s expenses for each day.
- The total daily expenses should be calculated and displayed under the specific date.
- Tooltips should be shown when users hover over any expense field, revealing more detailed information about the purpose of the expense.

4. **Spending Limit:**

   - Upon starting, the user should be prompted to set a monthly spending limit.
   - Users can set a spending limit for each category (e.g., Groceries: $200, Transportation: $50).
   - Users should not be able to add expenses that exceed the set limits.
   - The system should alert users when they have reached their spending limit for any specific categories

5. **Technologies Required:**

   - Frontend: HTML, raw CSS, Next JS, Redux Toolkit
   - Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
   - Database: MongoDB

6. **Redux Toolkit for State Management:**

   - Use Redux Toolkit to manage the application state efficiently.
   - Define actions and reducers using createSlice to handle tasks, including creation, updates, deletion, filtering, and reminders.
   - Ensure that Redux slices are well-organized and located in appropriate directories to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.

**Backend Integration:**

- The backend should be built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB for data storage.
- Create simple API endpoints for:
  - Creating a task (`POST /api/tasks`)
  - Retrieving tasks (`GET /api/tasks`)
  - Updating a task (`PUT /api/tasks/:id`)
  - Deleting a task (`DELETE /api/tasks/:id`)
- Document the API endpoints in the README.

**Restrictions:**

- Please don't use any CSS libraries
- Please use Next.js as frontEnd frameworks
- Style your application using raw CSS / inline styles

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Code should be clean, modular, and maintainable, with appropriate comments explaining key parts.
- The application must be a single-page application and fully functional without page reloads.
- Avoid using unnecessary dependencies; only use essential packages.

**Submission Guidelines:**

- Submit the application as a Git repository, by replying the email
- Include a README file detailing the application setup, how to run it, and any known issues or limitations.
- All code must be original, and candidates should refrain from using online solutions or tutorials.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Quality of the frontend code and UI/UX design.
- Proper integration with the backend API endpoints and use of Redux for state management.
- Responsiveness, accessibility, and user-friendliness of the application.
- Cleanliness, modularity, and maintainability of the codebase.
- Creativity and problem-solving in adhering to task requirements.
